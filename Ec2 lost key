 3 Steps to retrieving an ec2 instances if you lost your private key
       step 1 #USING VOLUMES
 You'll create another EC2 instance in the same regoin using the same availability zone as the previous one the key was lost in.
 then STOP the current EC2 instace which key was lost
 then proceed to volume to detach the volume of the stopped ec2 instance and attach the volume of the newly created ec2 instance to the currently stopped volume
 then, proceed to your CLI and SSH with your newly launched instance 
 Check the volumes attached to your EC2 instance using the synthax $ lsblk
 Youll see a file which is not yet mounted usually named 'xvdf'
 Create a folder named Volume in your home directory
 Then mount the disk inside the Volume folder you just created using the synthax $ sudo mount /dev/xvdf1/ Volume/ or sudo mount -o nouuid /dev/xvdf1 Volume/
 Generate yor ssh key using $ ssh-keygen -t rsa then cd into your volume directory to put your authorized key in the folder using the synthax $ "sudo cp ~/.ssh/authoriuzed keys ." 
 cd back into your home directory to unmount the volume disk $sudo umount /dev/xvdf1
 check your listed volumes again with the command $lsblk
 go back to your aws mgt console to detach the volume from your recovery instance and re-attach it back to your original instance 
 ### wHILE RE-ATTACHING THE VOLUME, CHANGE THE NAME PATH TO "/dev/xvda"
 finally start your original instance USING your recovery instance private key.
